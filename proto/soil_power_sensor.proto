/* @brief Implements serialization for measurements on the Soil Power Sensor
 * 
 * Each individual measurement has all identifying information for someone to
 * determine when the measurement happened, who performed the measurement, what
 * was being measured, and the measurement itself. In the scheme of the Soil
 * Power Sensor, single measurements are taken, then saved to NVRAM for a later
 * upload. This was perferred over using "repeated" types as the data would have
 * to be uploaded in blocks of LoRaWAN due to payload size limitations.
