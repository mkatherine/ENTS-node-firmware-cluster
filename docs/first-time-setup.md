[ ] Clear the bootloader the stm32. (See [stm32/README.md](stm32/README.md) for instructions)
[ ] Run unit tests on the stm32. (See [stm32/README.md](stm32/README.md) for instructions)
[ ] Flash `stm32` environment firmware to the stm32. (See [stm32/README.md](stm32/README.md) for instructions)
[ ] Flash the `release` firmware to the esp32. (See [esp32/README.md](esp32/README.md) for instructions)
