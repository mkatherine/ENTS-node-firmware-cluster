## [2.3.0] - 2025-02-26

Code used for March of the ENTS experiment. Release includes support for the
bme280, larger fram chip, teros21, and integration with a desktop GUI for
device configuration. The experiment revelated multiple bugs that will be fixed
in future releases including the following:
