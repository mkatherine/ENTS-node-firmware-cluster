# RG191 LoRaWAN Gateway
The RG191 (the US version) was used with [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) to develop and test the LoRaWAN firmware. Follow The Things Network documentation for the *Laird Sentrius RG191 LoRaWAN Gateway* for setup. The default username is `sentrius` and password is `RG1xx`. Setup the gateway with CUPS configuration. When configuring use the *Minimal Certificate List*.

## Factory reset

We found the user guide did not provide the correct instructions to factory reset the gateway. The following steps were used to reset the gateway:
1. Unplug the gateway
2. While unplugged, hold down the *user* button
3. Continuing to hold the *user* button plug back in the device
4. Release the *user* button after all the indicator lights are flashing indicating a factory reset is being performed
