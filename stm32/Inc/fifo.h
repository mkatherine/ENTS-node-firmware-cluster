 * @brief    Circular buffer as FIFO data structure for buffering measurements
 * 
 * A circular buffer is implemented on part of the memory space of the fram
 * chip. The address space used can be modified with FRAM_BUFFER_START and
 * FRAM_BUFFER_END depending on user needs.
 * 
 * Measurements are stored with a single uint8_t of their length followed by
 * the serialized protobuf message. On reads, the length is first read, then
 * the length number of bytes are read into RAM. Ensure the read buffer used
 * is of sufficient size.
 * 
 * The buffer's implementation does not allow for overwriting of data. Once
 * the buffer is full, indicated by FRAM_BUFFER_FULL, data needs to be removed
 * by getting the next measurement or clearing the buffer entirely.
