 * @brief WiFi interface for the esp32
 *
 *
 * The *WiFiCommand* message is used to control the WiFi hardware on the esp32
 * module. There are two types: (1) `CONNECT` which is used to connect to the
 * WiFi network and (2) `POST` which sends data to an API endpoint.

 * @image html WiFiCommand.png "WiFiCommand Message Structure" width=60%
 *
 * The return code (`rc`) message serves dual purpose based on the type and
 * direction of communication. For the `CONNECT`, the return code is used to
 * send a WiFi enum directly from Arduino `WiFi.status()`. See [this
 * file](https://github.com/arduino/wifishield/blob/0d0b242c794e3e91126fd72dbcca906829226128/firmware/wifiHD/src/wl_definitions.h#L28)
 * for possible values. For `POST` the return code is used to store the HTTP
 * response code from the *POST* request. See [HTTP status
 * code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for possible
 * values.
 *
 * The software flow for WiFi is as follows:

/**

 * The enum is copied from the Arduino WiFi library. See the following for the

 *
 * The meaning of these can be ambiguous. See the following forum for the
 * sequence of status during connect and disconnect events:
