/**
 * @ingroup stm32
 * @defgroup sensors Sensors
 * @brief Sensors library provides the interface between taking measurements
 * and uploading them to the server
 *
 * Provides an interface for querying sensors and adding the measurements to the
 * transmit buffer. Functions to query sensors are registered and called on a
 * interval that is global to all sensors.
 *
 * The library expects all initialization code for registered sensors to be
 * called before SensorsStart. The timer utility library (UTIL_TIMER_Init) and
 * sequencer utility (UTIL_SEQ_Init) must be initialized as well.
 *
 * Currently there is no way to modify or remove sensors after adding the
 * callback function. This is based on the assumption sensors are not going
 * to be dynamically added or removed during firmware runtime. Also new sensors
 * will require updates to the firmware binaries.
 *
 * The measurement interval is determined by the user. This value should be an
 * order of magnitude greater than the upload frequency that is defined by
 * APP_TX_DUTY_CYCLE.
